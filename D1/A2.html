        <h1><u>Difference between var, let and const in Javascript:</u></h1>
        <h3>1.var:</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>var is a keyword used in javascript.</li>
            <li>var statement is used to declare a variable.</li>
            <li>if the variable is not assigned to any value, it shows undefined while trying to print that variable.</li>
            <li>you can assign the value to the variable using '='.</li>
            <li>its not mandatory yo assign the value immediately, you can assign the value it before using that variable.</li>
            <li>the variables declared using var keyword are function scoped, which means the variables can be used anywhere in the program.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
           <script>
               var city;
               console.log(city);
               city = "Hyderabad";
               console.log(city);
           </script>
        <h3>2.let:</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>let is a keyword in javascript.</li>
            <li>let is also used to declare variables.</li>
            <li>the variable declared inside let is block scoped.</li>
            <li>these variables declared using let, cannot be used outside the block.</li>          
        </ul>
        </p>
           <script>
               var city = "Bangalore";
               console.log(city);
               {
                   let city = "Delhi";
                   console.log(city);
                   city = "Chennai";
                   console.log(city);
               }
               console.log(city);
               city = "Mumbai";
               console.log(city);   
           </script>
           <h3>3.const:</h3>
           <p><ul>
               <li>const is a keyword in javascript.</li>
               <li>constant can be declared using const in javascript.</li>
               <li>const is similar to let when it comes to block scope</li>
               <li>once a constant is been declared, we cannot reassign it to a new value.</li>
           </ul>
            </p>
              <script>
                  var x = 6;
                  console.log(x);
                  {
                      const x = 12;
                      console.log(x);
                  }
                  console.log(x);
              </script>
